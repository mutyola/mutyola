### ðŸ˜„ My Bio :

âš¡ I am a teacher, and overall, I am a lifelong learner who is passionate about education and technology. I love teaching and sharing my knowledge with others, and I believe technology can be a powerful tool for education. Whether its using Machine learning to better understand complex data or leveraging digital marketing to promote educational resources, I am always looking for new ways to help my students and colleagues learn and grow.
âš¡ My ultimate goal is to help bridge the gap between technology and education in Zambia and Africa at large. I believe that intergrating technology into education, we can provide more opportunities for students to learn and grow, and prepare them for the rapidly evolving technological landscape.
âš¡ In addition to my teaching role, I am also acting Chief Executive Officer of a startup called AGMTECH ENTERPRISE, which focuses on developing innovative technology solutions for businesses and individuals. As a trained Digital Marketer, I undersatand the importance of creating effective marketing strategies that utilise the latest technologies.
In my freetime, I enjoy exploring new technologies and tinkering with code. I am costantly learning and expanding my skill set. I am committed to making a positive impact on the lives of others.
